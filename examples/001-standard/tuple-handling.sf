// there are actually 2 arguments given, $a and <undef>, $a will be filled with "1", <undef> with ("2", "3")
$a, = foo.bar();            // $a = "1"

// <undef>,$b,$c. 3 arguments, so all three can be filled
,$b, $c = foo.bar();        // $b = "2", $c = "3"

// 2 args, <undef> filled with "1", and $b with ("2" and "3")

/* PROBLEM: if we apply the expression onto itself when there is no LeftHandValue given, what should the following do?
 *
 * $foo1 = "1";
 * $foo2 = "2";
 * $foo3 = "3";
 * $a, ,$c = $foo1.int(), $foo2.int(), $foo3.int()
 *
 * Since only $a en $c are filled, and the middle is not assigned, does this mean that
 *   $foo1 = "1", $a = 1;
 *   $foo3 = "3", $c = 3;
 * but:
 *   $foo2 = 2;  // Since we cast and assign to none, we assume ourself?
